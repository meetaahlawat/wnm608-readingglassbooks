We can order any current title that is not in stock and have it in a day or two, and we also search for elusive out-of-print titles.

    <p>The reading glass bookstore offers the pleasure, increasingly rare, of a small intimate shop stocked with quality literature and staffed by friendly, professional book people. Starting the bookstore was a challenge, maintaining it was an effort, but watching it succeed has been a joy. We invite you to come in and browse, on this website or—preferably—in person.</p>
